A modern e-commerce application built with Next.js 14+ App Router, featuring separate marketing and dashboard layouts with authentication.

## 🤖 AI Tools Used

- **Kiro AI Assistant** - Primary development assistant for:
  - Project architecture and structure
  - Component creation and refactoring
  - Layout implementation
  - Authentication flow
  - API integration
  - Bug fixing and optimization

## 💬 Prompting Approach

### Initial Setup
- Started with backend API endpoint information
- Requested specific features (customer addresses page)
- Provided API response structure for accurate implementation

### Iterative Development
1. **Feature Requests**: Clear, specific requests like "create customer address management page"
2. **Problem Solving**: Reported errors directly (e.g., "404 Not Found", "user redirects to login")
3. **Refinements**: Asked for improvements (e.g., "match background colors", "add metadata")
4. **Architecture Changes**: Requested structural changes (e.g., "separate marketing and dashboard layouts")

### Effective Prompting Patterns
- ✅ "Make the addresses page" → Clear goal
- ✅ "Solve the errors" → Direct problem statement
- ✅ "If user not found, redirect to login" → Specific requirement
- ✅ "Add metadata for all pages, only title" → Precise scope

## 🛠️ Manual Changes Made

### None Required
All code was generated and implemented by the AI assistant with no manual intervention needed. The AI:
- Created proper file structure
- Implemented authentication logic
- Set up route groups for layouts
- Fixed bugs and errors autonomously
- Refactored components for better architecture

### Dual Layout System
- **Marketing Layout**: Navbar + Footer for public pages
- **Dashboard Layout**: Sidebar + Topbar for authenticated pages
- Route groups `(marketing)` and `(dashboard)` for clean separation

### Authentication
- Login/Register with form validation
- Protected dashboard routes
- Automatic redirect to login if unauthorized
- API proxy with token management

### Customer Addresses
- View all customer addresses
- Add new addresses with full form
- Address type selection (shipping/billing)
- Default address marking

### UI/UX
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Custom 404 pages
- Proper SEO metadata

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API_URL

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🔑 Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url_here
```

## 📝 Development Notes

### Component Architecture
- Server components for pages (better SEO)
- Client components for interactivity
- Proper separation of concerns

### Authentication Flow
1. Dashboard layout checks for user
2. Redirects to login if not authenticated
3. API proxy handles 401/403 responses
4. Automatic logout and redirect on auth failure

### Metadata Strategy
- Static metadata for server components
- Dynamic `document.title` for client components
- Consistent branding across all pages

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT implementation
